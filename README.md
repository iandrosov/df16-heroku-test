# DF16 Heroku App in Action - Mini Hack #5

## Swagger generated server

## Overview
This is a solution code in Node.js for Dreamforce16 Heroku Mini Hack #5. This challenge does not restrict what langauge to use to solve it. Example given was in Python using this [blog post](http://clouddatafacts.com/heroku-connect/flask_psycopg2/flask_psycopg2_prebuilt_get.html), but I chose to use Node.js since Heroku is polyglot pltaform we can run any language. This github repo is used for simpler Heroku deployments from github & Swagger was used to qick-start to generate a code harness for api-web-app.

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This is an example of building a node.js server.

This example uses the [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/) framework.  To see how to make this your own, look here:

[README](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/README.md)

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
